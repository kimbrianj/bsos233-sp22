    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Central Limit Theorem** is perhaps the most famous theorem in statistics and is used as the basis for many statistical hypothesis tests. In short, the Central Limit Theorem states that as long as you have a large enough sample size, the sampling distribution of sample means or sample proportions will be approximately Normal (that is, bell-shaped, unimodal, symmetric). This is extremely valuable, because it allows us to determine the sampling distribution given that an initial assumption (the null hypothesis) is true, and evaluate whether our data is unusual or unlikely within that distribution. \n",

    "In this lab, we will explore some of the concepts of the Central Limit Theorem, use simulations to generate an empirical sampling distribution, and form the basis of how hypothesis testing will be done. "
