Tables are what we will use to bring in data from CSV files, work with data by looking at different subsets and slices of the dataset, and even store results of analyses in the future. Because of this, the Table might be the most important object type for this course. \n",

    "## Review: The building blocks of Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An **expression** is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here are two expressions that both evaluate to 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3\n",
    "    5 - 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",
    "| `round`    | Rounds its argument to the nearest integer                     |\n",

    "    max(round(2.8), min(pow(2, 10), -1 * pow(2, 10)))\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `5 - 2` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `5 - 2` combines the expressions `5` and `2` by subtraction.  In this case, `5` and `2` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to think about this is that we're **evaluating the right-hand side** of the equals sign and **assigning it to the left-hand side**. Here are some assignment statements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    height = 1.3\n",
    "    the_number_five = abs(-5)\n",
    "    absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a lot is going on in the last statement above, but it's really just a combination of a few things.  This picture describes what's going on.\n",
