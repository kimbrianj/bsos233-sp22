    "Programs like Siri or Google Now begin the process of understanding human speech by classifying short clips of raw sound into basic categories called *phones*.  For example, the recorded sound of someone saying the word \"robot\" might be broken down into several phones: \"rrr\", \"oh\", \"buh\", \"aah\", and \"tuh\".  Phones are then grouped together into further categories like words (\"robot\") and sentences (\"I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords\") that carry more meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A visual language like Libras has an analogous structure.  Instead of phones, each word is made up of several *hand movements*.  As a first step in interpreting Libras, we can break down a video clip into small segments, each containing a single hand movement.  The task is then to figure out what hand movement each segment represents.\n",

    "The [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/libras/movement_libras.names) in this exercise come from Dias, Peres, and Biscaro, researchers at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  They identified 15 distinct hand movements in Libras (probably an oversimplification, but a useful one) and captured short videos of signers making those hand movements.  (You can read more about their work [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5161636%2F5178557%2F05178917.pdf&authDecision=-203). The paper is gated, so you will need to use the UMD Wi-Fi or VPN to access it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each video, they chose 45 still frames from the video and identified the location (in horizontal and vertical coordinates) of the signer's hand in each frame.  Since there are two coordinates for each frame, this gives us a total of 90 numbers summarizing how a hand moved in each video.  Those 90 numbers will be our *attributes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each video is *labeled* with the kind of hand movement the signer was making in it.  Each label is one of 15 strings like \"horizontal swing\" or \"vertical zigzag\".\n",
